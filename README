Arduino Libraries  v0012.1 (1/04/09)

WHAT : 
This is the default libraries from arduino + modifications and aditional community
libraries. Community libraries will be listed below with links, as well as any notes
of changes to the official arduino libraries. 

This repo should live in hardware/libraries in your arduino dir
(e.g /Applications/arduino-0012/hardware/libraries )

Currently based on: ver 0012 (will merge in new versions changes and increment this
								number when released.)

WHY :
This was setup to provide a git repository of the arduino libraries, as well as a good
place for modified/additional code to be stored with revision control.
