This is the default libraries from arudino + modifications, as well as additional
libraries I've found and modified / wrote. This is being setup as a additional
git repo, because the libraries have to live in a fixed directory, and I want
stuff version controlled, so the whole lot has to be imported. A good reference
for creating libraries is here: http://www.arduino.cc/en/Hacking/LibraryTutorial

This repo should live in hardware/libraries in your arduino dir
(e.g /Applications/arduino-0011/hardware/libraries )

Currently based on: ver 0011 (will merge in new versions changes and increment this
								number when released.)
								
FILES/MODIFICATIONS:
(nb: default stuff that hasn't changed not listed.)
